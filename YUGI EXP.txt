I created a new Java class named Deckstats, representing a Yugi deck, where I defined four private attributes: attribute, level, typeAndMonsterCategory, and ATKandDEF. In the constructor for Deckstats, I set up the new deck by accepting four parameters: ATKandDEF, attribute, level, and typeAndMonsterCategory, and assigned these values to the respective attributes using the "this" keyword. Then, I added a method called displayDeck() within the Deckstats class to show all the details of a Yugi deck, printing out its attribute values like attribute, level, type/monster category, and ATK/DEF using print statements. In the main class (App class), I modified it to demonstrate the usage of the Deckstats class, where I created two new Yugi decks (newdeck and newdeck2) using the Deckstats class, providing specific details for each deck. Finally, I printed out these details to see how the decks look like.
